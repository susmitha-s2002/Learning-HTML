<body> => This is the body element of the HTML document. It contains the content of the document.


Some elements have starting tag and ending tag. some do not like <br> [<a> , </a>]

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag, but try not to forget the end tag.
