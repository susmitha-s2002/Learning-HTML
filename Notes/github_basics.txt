Setting Up SSH:

Check if there are any existing SSH keys in your laptop by this command:
    ls -al ~/.ssh
        Explanation:
            ls => to list all the files
            ~al => it even lists the hidden files
            ~/.ssh => to list all the files in the .ssh folder
                ~ means home directory, to check what is the value of ~ [ use this command: echo ~]
                ssh keys are generally stored in home directory's .ssh hidden file. so we are checking there.

If there are no keys, you can create one by this command:
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
        Explanation:
            This command generates SSH keys using the ed25519 algorithm.
            ssh-keygen => The tool used to generate SSH keys.
            -t ed25519 => Specifies the Ed25519 algorithm (more secure & faster than RSA).
            -C "your-email@example.com"	=> Adds a comment (your email) to the key for identification. (in pub key)

After creating ssh keys, run the ssh agent by using the command:
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
        Explanation:
            ssh-agent => The tool used to manage SSH keys.
            -s => Start the ssh-agent.
            eval => Run the command and store the output in a variable. (it give the pid of ssh agent)

Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent by using the command:
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        Explanation:
            ssh-add => The tool used to add SSH keys to the ssh-agent.
            ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 => The path to the SSH key file you want to add.


Copy the public key to your GitHub account by using the command:
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        Explanation:
            pbcopy => The tool used to copy text to the clipboard.
            < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub => The path to the SSH key file you want to copy.

Now, add this public key to the github.

Test the SSH connection by this command:
    ssh -T git@github.com
        Explanation:
            ssh => The tool used to establish an SSH connection.
            -T => Test the SSH connection.
            git@github.com => The GitHub repository URL.


Creating the Repository:

Create the repository online in github.

Clone the repository by this command:
    git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
        Explanation:
            git => The tool used to manage Git repositories.
            clone => The command used to clone a repository.
            git@github.com:username/repository-name.git => The URL of the repository you want to clone.

Now, a new folder will get created.
go inside the folder and make necessary changes

and do these commands:
    git add abc.txt
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git push origin main

To ignore certain files:
    touch .gitignore => a new file will get created
    here you add the directory which you want to ignore
    example:
        node_modules/ => Ignore the node_modules folder.
        *.log => Ignore all .log files
        .idea/ => Ignore the .idea folder.
