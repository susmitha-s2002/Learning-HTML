üî∏ Why is HTML named HTML?
  HyperText:
    ‚ÄúHyper‚Äù means beyond or more.
    ‚ÄúText‚Äù refers to content (words, sentences).

  HyperText allows you to link one piece of text (or element) to another.
  Clicking a link takes you from one element to another, which is the hyper part (i.e., non-linear navigation).

  Markup:
    Markup means adding special tags to text to describe its structure.
    HTML uses tags like <p> (paragraph), <h1> (heading), <a> (link) to "mark" text.

  Language:
    HTML is called a language because it has specific rules (syntax) that browsers understand.

  üß© In short:
  HTML = HyperText + Markup + Language
  It‚Äôs a language that structures text into clickable, navigable content on the web.



üî∏ Markup Language:
  Purpose:
    A markup language is used to define the structure and presentation of content (like text, images, etc.) on a web page or document.
    It doesn‚Äôt perform calculations, logic, or actions by itself. It simply organizes or describes content.

    Examples:
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to structure and organize content on web pages.
      XML (eXtensible Markup Language): Used to store and transport data.
      Markdown: A lightweight markup language for formatting text.

    Key Features:
      Uses tags (e.g., <h1>, <p>, <a>) to mark up content.
      Describes the structure and presentation of data.
      No logic or decision-making involved (it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything beyond display content).

üî∏ Programming Language:
  Purpose:
    A programming language is used to write instructions that a computer can execute.
    It allows you to create programs, perform calculations, control hardware, or manage the flow of information.

    Examples:
      Python, JavaScript, Java, C++: Used for creating software applications, websites, games, etc.

    Key Features:
      Uses syntax and commands to control the behavior of a computer.
      Includes logic (e.g., conditionals like if statements, loops like for and while).
      Can perform calculations, handle input/output, and manage state.


| Aspect              | **Markup Language**             | **Programming Language**              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Structures and formats content  | Performs operations and logic         |
| **Examples**        | HTML, XML, Markdown             | Python, JavaScript, Java, C++         |
| **Tags**            | Uses tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`) | No tags (uses code and statements)    |
| **Logic/Execution** | No logic or execution (static)  | Can execute logic, calculations, etc. |
| **Output**          | Displays content (text, images) | Performs tasks, calculates results    |

HTML is used to get skeleton of the webpage.

HTML File structure:
<!DOCTYPE html> => this tells that this is an html document. this should be the first line of your html file.
<html> => all the html content is wrapped inside this.
<head> => contains meta_data about the page (not visible to users). include title, css, fonts etc.
<body> => the visible content of the page
